AWS elastic Disaster Recovery 


in the architecture there are source and aws server 

in the architecture source server is continously replicating its data to replication server and also communicating with DRS

we have to creat iam user with AWS elastic disaster recovery agent installation policy 

in case of failback we need to creatre anpther iam user with AWS elastic diaster recovery failback agent installation policy

step 1:

Launch an source server instances

step 2:

goto AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery and create default settings to the account

step 3:

create a new IAM user with AWS lastic disaster recovery agent installation policy 


then connect the instance and run the aws replication elastic disaster recovery installer command 

after the installation there is a instance in created in source server and ec2

and it has started to replicate the content from the  source server to the replication servicer 

once the AWS elastic disaster recovery conversion server is disconnected then ip-172-31-39-85.ec2.internal replication server starts the service
